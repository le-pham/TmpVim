# TmpVim

## Description

A Python script that copies the currently selected text to the system clipboard and then opens it in an external text editor for modification.

## How to use

1. Download and Save: Download the script and save it to a convenient location on your computer.

2. Customize the Script: Open the script in a text editor. You'll need to specify your preferred external editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++) and the desired location for the temporary file where the text will be stored.

3. Assign a Hotkey: Create a shortcut to run the script. Use your operating system's settings or a third-party application to assign a global hotkey that will execute the Python script. This allows you to quickly activate it from any application.
